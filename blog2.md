After reducing the amount of course term projects for the semester
and reupdating this forked repo on the 395 branch, I will soo set about the 
application of my cmpt491 course project that is to be stylized in LaTex
onto the jupyter notebook. The contents of the paper will speak for itself
with a set of screen caps that describe the process of adding the nefarious
details.

An awesome thing about jupyter is that it has so many dimensions for reporting
in general; the aspect of coding onto the report itself saves oodles of time
from the back and forth that a typical undergrad would go through in making
reports for labs, research or whatever data detailing nessecary.
