##Thus far...
-----------

After reducing the amount of course term projects for the semester
and reupdating this forked repo on the 395 branch, I will soo set about the 
application of my cmpt491 course project that is to be stylized in LaTex
onto the jupyter notebook. The contents of the paper will speak for itself
with a set of screen caps that describe the process of adding the nefarious
details.

An awesome thing about jupyter is that it has so many dimensions for reporting
in general; the aspect of coding onto the report itself saves oodles of time
from the back and forth that a typical undergrad would go through in making
reports for labs, research or whatever data detailing necessary.

##Attempt: Making a graph of csv data
-------------------

Over the course of this semester, I needed a data set in order to actually 
data-mine. Our group used the Canadian Center of Disease control to find some
trends in chronic health illness. For the sake of introducing the usability of
this notebook, we will attempt to plot the process of plotting the Health data's
csv file content.

First, you must make sure that you have pandas. What is it? Pandas is just the
tabular structure which must be imported so that the user can actually tabulate their 
data. Pretty straight forward. We need this line in order to aquire it on the CS50 VM:

```
sudo pip install pandas ipython[all] jupyter
```
